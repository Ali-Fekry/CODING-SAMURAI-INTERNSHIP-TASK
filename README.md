## 🌦️ 2️⃣ Weather App (Using OpenWeatherMap API)

### 🔍 Description
A Python Weather App that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data for any city entered by the user.
It provides live temperature, humidity, wind speed, and general weather conditions.

### ⚙️ Features
Real-time weather information fetched via a live API  
Displays:  
City and Country  
Temperature (°C)  
Feels-like temperature  
Weather Condition (e.g., clear sky, cloudy, rain)  
Humidity (%)  
Wind Speed (m/s)  
Handles invalid city names and API errors gracefully  
Uses clean JSON data parsing with the requests library  

### 🔑 Requirements
Python: version 3.7 or above  
Library: requests  
API Key: Free from OpenWeatherMap  
To install the required dependency:  
pip install requests  

### 💻 How to Run 
Get your free API key from OpenWeatherMap  
Open the file weather_app.py  
Replace: api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual API key.  
Run the app using the following command: python calculator.py  
Type any city name to get its current weather.  

### 🧠 Example Output
=== Weather App ===  
Enter city name (or 'exit' to quit): Cairo
🌤 Weather in Cairo, EG:
Temperature: 27°C (Feels like 26°C)
Condition: Clear sky
Humidity: 41%
Wind Speed: 3.6 m/s
